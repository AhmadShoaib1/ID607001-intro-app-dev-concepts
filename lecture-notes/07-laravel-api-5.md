# 07: Laravel API 5

## Postman Documentation

You can automatically generate documentation for your API. Your documentation is generated and hosted by Postman and is based on the collections you create. You can share your documentation privately with your team members or publicly on the web. 

Here are the following steps:

1. Click on the **Create Collection** button. **Note:** this example is using the **Postman** web client.

2. A new **collection** has been created. Click on the **horizontal ellipsis (three circles)** and click on the **Add request** option.

3. Choose a method (I chose `POST` for this example) and add your **Heroku** API URL and endpoint.

5. If required, add the appropriate form and response data for that **Heroku** API URL and endpoint. **Note:** you will not be required to provide form data for a `GET` and `DELETE` action.
