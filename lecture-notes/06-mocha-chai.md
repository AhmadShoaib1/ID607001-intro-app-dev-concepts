# 06: Node.js Mocha & Chai

## Mocha

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser.

First, we need to install **Mocha** as a dependency:

```bash
$ npm i mocha
```

Then we'll create a new folder in the root called `test` and put a file inside called `test.js`.
