## Before We Start

Open your **s2-24-intro-app-dev-repo-GitHub username** repository in **Visual Studio Code**. Create a new branch called **week-09-formative-assessment** from **week-08-formative-assessment**.

> **Note:** There are a lot of code examples. Typing the code examples rather than copying and pasting is strongly recommended. It will help you remember the code better. Also, read the comments in the code examples. It will help you understand where to type the code.

## Formative Assessment

If you get stuck on any of the following tasks, feel free to use **ChatGPT** permitting, you are aware of the following:

- If you provide **ChatGPT** with a prompt that is not refined enough, it may generate a not-so-useful response
- Do not trust **ChatGPT's** responses blindly. You must still use your judgement and may need to do additional research to determine if the response is correct
- Acknowledge that you are using **ChatGPT**. In the **README.md** file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to **ChatGPT** and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work
