\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop a \textbf{REST API} using \textbf{Express} and \textbf{Node.js}, and deploy it as a \textbf{web service} on \textbf{Render}. You will choose the theme of your \textbf{REST API}. It could be on sport, culture, food or something else you are interested in. Your data will be stored in a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database on \textbf{Render}. Also, you will develop a \textbf{React application}. This application will consume the \textbf{REST API} mentioned above. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a \textbf{full-stack application}, rather to demonstrate an ability to decouple your \textbf{REST API} from your \textbf{React CRUD application}. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation and \textbf{Git} usage.

\section*{Learning Outcome}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design and build secure applications with dynamic database functionality following an appropriate software development methodology.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete majority of this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. Part 1 will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 15 September 2023 at 4.59 PM} and Part 2 will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 10 November 2023 at 4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} across all assessments in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/wJ4pC7Y7}{https://classroom.github.com/a/wJ4pC7Y7}. Create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest program files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test your \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch application before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{9:00 AM}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}. 

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Extensions will \textbf{only} be granted if you are unable to complete the assessment by the due date because of \textbf{unforeseen circumstances outside your control}. The length of the extension granted will depend on the circumstances and \textbf{must} be negotiated with the course lecturer before the assessment due date. A medical certificate or support letter may be needed. Extensions will not be granted for poor time management or pressure of other assessments.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Developed using \textbf{Node.js}.
		\item Can run locally and in production without modification.
		\item A \textbf{maximum} of \textbf{eight} \textbf{models}. Each containing a \textbf{minimum} of \textbf{four} \textbf{fields} excluding the \textbf{id}, \textbf{createdAt} and \textbf{updatedAt} \textbf{fields}.
		\item A range of different data types, i.e., all \textbf{fields} in a \textbf{model} can not be of a single type.
		\item A minimum of \textbf{five relationships} between \textbf{models}.
		\item At least \textbf{one} \textbf{model} has an \textbf{enum} \textbf{field}. 
		\item A \textbf{controller} and \textbf{route} file for each \textbf{model}. Each \textbf{controller} file needs to contain operations for \textbf{POST}, \textbf{GET all}, \textbf{GET one}, \textbf{PUT} and \textbf{DELETE}.
		\item Return an appropriate success or failure message, and status code when performing the operations, i.e., \textbf{"Successfully created an institution"} or \textbf{"No institutions found"}, and \textbf{200} or \textbf{404}.
		\item The \textbf{index route}, i.e., \textbf{https://localhost:3000/api/} needs to display all existing \textbf{routes}. \textbf{Note:} This can be hardcoded.
		\item When creating and updating, validate each \textbf{field} using \textbf{Joi}. 
		\item Store your data in a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database on \textbf{Render}.
