# **React**

## What is React
**React** is a **JavaScript** component-based library developed by **Facebook**. 

Here are some reasons why people use **React**:
- Applications can handle complex updates such as fetching large amounts of data and still feel fast and responsive.
- You can write reusable and small pieces of code rather than large chunks of code. It solves the maintainability issue that you tend to have when writing vanilla **HTML**.
- Performs well in large applications, particularly when you need to fetch, change and display data.

**Will I use React anywhere else in the BIT degree?**
Yes. You will use **React** in **Advanced Application Development**. If you choose to do **Mobile** or **Web** in **Studio 5/6**, you will use **React** or **React Native**.

**Note:** there are plenty of component-based libraries and frameworks out there. The most popular ones are **Angular**, **React**, and **Vue.js**.
