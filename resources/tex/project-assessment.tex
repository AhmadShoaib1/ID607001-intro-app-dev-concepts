\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will develop \& deploy a \textbf{frontend} application using \textbf{React} which consumes your \textbf{Laravel API} from the \textbf{Practical} assessment. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a full-stack application, rather demonstrate an ability to decouple the \textbf{frontend} application from the \textbf{backend} application. Also, you will extend your \textbf{Laravel API} to include protected routes using \textbf{Laravel middleware}. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git} usage.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design \& build usable, secure \& attractive applications with dynamic database functionality following an appropriate software development methodology.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner managed time, however, there will be availability during the teaching sessions to discuss the requirements \& your progress of this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Thursday, 24 June 2021 at 12:00 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{IN607: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment must be completely your work \& any references must be cited appropriately. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/AzmNCm2h}{https://classroom.github.com/a/AzmNCm2h}. The latest program files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to run your application. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually must be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{IN607: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Instructions}
You will need to submit an application \& documentation that meet the following requirements:

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1 (50\%)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Laravel API application (backend):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Protect each route with a token value of your choice.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Resource:} \footnotesize\href{https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/middleware}{https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/middleware}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item React application (frontend):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Request \textbf{API} data from at least three \textbf{API} resource groups using \textbf{Axios}.
		\item Create new \textbf{API} data via a form. You \textbf{must} display the form in a modal.
		\item Incorrectly formatted form field values handled gracefully using validation error messages, i.e., \textbf{first name} form field is required.
		\item View \textbf{API} data in a table using a variety of ids \& query parameters. 
		\item Paginate \textbf{API} data across several pages with \textbf{next} \& \textbf{previous} links.
		\item Update \textbf{API} data via a form. Much like creating \textbf{API} data, you must display the form in a modal. 
		\item Delete \textbf{API} data. Prompt the user for deletion. You may \textbf{not} use the in-built \textbf{confirm()} function.
		\item Visually attractive user-interface with a coherent graphical theme \& style using \textbf{Reactstrap}.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Resource:} \footnotesize\href{https://reactstrap.github.io}{https://reactstrap.github.io}
		\end{itemize}
		\item End-to-end tests cover creating, updating, deleting \textbf{API} data \& viewing \textbf{API} data using a variety of query parameters. You \textbf{must} create a \textbf{NPM} script in your application's \textbf{package.json} that automates this.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Resource:} \footnotesize\href{https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell}{https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html\#In-a-nutshell}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Applications deployed to \textbf{Heroku}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Elegance - Learning Outcomes 1 (40\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Idiomatic use of control flow, data structures \& in-built functions.
	\item Sufficient code modularity, i.e., UI split into independent reusable pieces.
	\item Components written as functional, not class.
	\item Adheres to a client-server architecture, i.e., the presentation layer (frontend) is separate from the business layer (backend).
	\item If necessary, header \& in-line comments explaining complex logic.
	\item Code files are formatted using \textbf{Prettier}. You \textbf{must} create a \textbf{NPM} script in your application's \textbf{package.json} that automates this.
	\item No dead or unused code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation \& Git Usage - Learning Outcomes 1 (10\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the following in your repository \textbf{README.md} file:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item URL to both applications on \textbf{Heroku}.
		      \item How do you setup the environment for development, i.e., after the repository is cloned, what do you need to run the both applications locally?
					\item How do you run the \textbf{end-to-end} tests?
					\item How do you deploy the \textbf{React} application to \textbf{Heroku}?
	      \end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{itemize}
	\item At least 10 feature branches excluding the \textbf{main} branch.
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Your branches must be prefix with \textbf{feature}, for example, \textbf{feature-$<$name of functional requirement$>$}.
			\item For each branch, merge your own pull request to the \textbf{main} branch.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Commit messages must reflect the context of each functional requirement change. \textbf{Do not} rewrite your \textbf{Git} history. It is important that the course lecturer can see how you worked on your assessment over time.
