## Kanban   

### What is Kanban?

**Kanban** is a **method** for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on **continuous delivery** while not overburdening the development team. Like **Scrum**, **Kanban** is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively.

### What is a Kanban Board?

A **Kanban board** is a **work and workflow visualisation tool** that enables you to optimize the flow of your work. **Physical Kanban boards**, like the one pictured here - <https://bit.ly/3HrWSIl>, typically use sticky notes on a whiteboard to communicate status, progress, and issues. Instead, we are going to use **GitHub Projects** to create a **Kanban board**.

### What is a Kanban Card?

A **Kanban card** is a **task** on a **Kanban board**. **Kanban cards** are used to represent work items and convey important information about the work item through custom fields.
