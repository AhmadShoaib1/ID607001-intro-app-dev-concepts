\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop a \textbf{REST API} using \textbf{Express} and \textbf{Node.js}, and deploy it as a \textbf{web service} on \textbf{Render}. You will choose the theme of your \textbf{REST API}. It could be on sport, culture, food or something else you are interested in. Your data will be stored in a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database on \textbf{Render}. Also, you will develop a \textbf{CRUD application} using \textbf{React}. This application will consume the \textbf{REST API} mentioned above. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a \textbf{full-stack application}, but rather to demonstrate an ability to decouple your \textbf{REST API} from your \textbf{CRUD application}. In addition, marks will be allocated for Code Quality and Best Practices, documentation and \textbf{Git} usage.

\section*{Learning Outcome}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design and build secure applications with dynamic database functionality following an appropriate software development methodology.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 21 June 2024} at \textbf{4.59 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} across all assessments in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all application files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/wlzE5yYo}{https://classroom.github.com/a/wlzE5yYo}. If you do not have not one, create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest application files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}. 

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Extensions will \textbf{only} be granted if you are unable to complete the assessment by the due date because of \textbf{unforeseen circumstances outside your control}. The length of the extension granted will depend on the circumstances and \textbf{must} be negotiated with the course lecturer before the assessment due date. A medical certificate or support letter may be needed. Extensions will not be granted for poor time management or pressure of other assessments.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Instructions}

\subsection*{Functionality:Learning Outcome 1 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{REST API:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Developed using \textbf{Node.js}.
		\item Can run in development and production without modification.
		\item \textbf{Six} \textbf{models}. Each \textbf{model} contains a \textbf{minimum} of \textbf{four} \textbf{fields} excluding the \textbf{id}, \textbf{createdAt} and \textbf{updatedAt} \textbf{fields}.
		\item A range of different data types, i.e., all \textbf{fields} in a \textbf{model} can not be of a single type.
		\item \textbf{Six relationships} between \textbf{models}.
		\item \textbf{One} \textbf{model} has an \textbf{enum} \textbf{field}. 
		\item A \textbf{controller} and \textbf{route} file for each \textbf{model}. Each \textbf{controller} file needs to contain operations for \textbf{POST}, \textbf{GET all}, \textbf{GET one}, \textbf{PUT} and \textbf{DELETE}.
		\item Return an appropriate success or failure message, and status code when performing the operations, i.e., \textbf{"Successfully created an institution"} or \textbf{"No institutions found"}, and \textbf{200} or \textbf{404}.
		\item \textbf{Filter} and \textbf{sort} your data using \textbf{query parameters}. All \textbf{fields} should be filterable and sortable (in ascending and descending order).
		\item \textbf{Paginate} your data using \textbf{query parameters}. The default number of data per page is 25.
		\item Return an appropriate message if an endpoint does not exist.
		\item The \textbf{index route}, i.e., \textbf{https://localhost:3000/api/} needs to display all existing \textbf{routes}. \textbf{Note:} This can be hardcoded.
		\item When creating and updating, validate each \textbf{field} using \textbf{Joi}. 
		\item Store your data in a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database on \textbf{Render}.
		\item Deploy your \textbf{REST API} as a \textbf{web service} on \textbf{Render}.
	\end{itemize}

		\item UI is visually attractive with a coherent graphical theme and style using \textbf{Reactstrap}.	
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Scripts:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Run your \textbf{REST API} and \textbf{CRUD application} locally.
		\item Create and apply a migration using \textbf{Prisma}.

  	\item Appropriate naming of files, variables, functions and resource groups.
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Resource groups are named with a plural noun instead of a noun or verb, i.e., \textbf{/api/v1/items} not \textbf{/api/v1/item}.
  \end{itemize}
	\item Idiomatic use of control flow, data structures and in-built functions.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation and Git Usage - Learning Outcome 1 (5\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{GitHub} project board to help you organise and prioritise your development work. The course lecturer needs to see consistent use of the \textbf{GitHub} project board for the duration of the assessment.
    \item Provide the following in your repository \textbf{README.md} file:
    \begin{itemize} 
	\item A URL to your \textbf{REST API} as a \textbf{web service} on \textbf{Render}.
	\item A URL to your published \textbf{REST API} documentation. Each route needs to be documented. Include a description, example request and example response.
      \item How do you setup the environments, i.e., after the repository is cloned?
	  \item How do you run your \textbf{REST API} and \textbf{CRUD application} locally?

    \end{itemize}
    \item Use of \textbf{Markdown}, i.e., headings, bold text, code blocks, etc.
    \item Correct spelling and grammar.
    \item Your \textbf{Git commit messages} should:
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Be formatted using an appropriate naming convention style.
    \end{itemize}	
\end{itemize} 

\subsection*{Additional Information}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Do not} rewrite your \textbf{Git} history. It is important that the course lecturer can see how you worked on your assessment over time. 
    \item You need to show the course lecturer the initial \textbf{GitHub} project board before you start your development work. Following this, you need to show the course lecturer your \textbf{GitHub} project board at the end of each week.
\end{itemize}
