\section*{Instructions}
The purpose of this in-class activity to familiarise yourself in-built functions in \textbf{PHP}.

\section*{Code Review}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your code review â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/P656imf2}{https://classroom.github.com/a/P656imf2}. Checkout from the \textbf{main} branch to the \textbf{03-in-class-activity} branch by running the command - \textbf{git checkout 03-in-class-activity}. This branch will be your development branch for this activity. Once you have completed this activity, create a pull request \& assign the \textbf{GitHub} user \textbf{grayson-orr} to a reviewer. \textbf{Do not} merge your own pull request.

\subsection*{Problem 1:}
What is a substring? it is a portion of a string, i.e., "Hello" is a substring of "Hello, World!" and "el" is a substring of "Hello". String manipulation is commonly used \& working with substrings is something you will do often. \\

You have been given the following sentence as a single \textbf{string}: \\

"The anemone, the wild violet, the hepatica, and the funny little curled-up ferns all peeped out at us from beneath the brown leaves." \\

\textbf{Output: 5} 
Use the \textbf{substr\_count()} function to return the number of occurrence of the word "the" in the sentence above.

\subsection*{Problem 2:}
Use \textbf{echo} \& the \textbf{strtolower()} function to display the following string in lowercase letters: \\

\textbf{Input: "YoU aRe dOIng A GReat jOB!"} \\
\textbf{Output: "you are doing a great job!"}

\subsection*{Problem 3:}
Which in-built function repeats a \textbf{string}. Please provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The name of the function
    \item Its parameters \& parameter descriptions
    \item Its return value
    \item A code example using the function
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problem 4:}
In this problem you are going to use the \textbf{abs()} function. Write a function called \textbf{calc\_dist} that calculates the distance between two \textbf{integers}. It does not matter which order the arguments are given, it should still return the same result. \\

\textbf{Input: calc\_dist(-1, 4)} \\
\textbf{Output: 5} \\

\textbf{Input: calc\_dist(4, -1)} \\
\textbf{Output: 5} 

\subsection*{Problem 5:}
In this problem you are going to use the \textbf{round()} function. Write a function called \textbf{calc\_tip} which accepts an \textbf{integer} representing the total cost of a breakfast meal as its argument. Your function should calculate a new total with a 15\% tip added \& return that value rounded to the nearest whole \textbf{integer}. \\

\textbf{Input: calc\_tip(100)} \\
\textbf{Output: 115} \\

\textbf{Input: calc\_tip(35)} \\
\textbf{Output: 41} 

\subsection*{Problem 6:}
Which in-built function parses a \textbf{string} as if it were the \textbf{query string} passed via a URL \& sets a variable in the current scope.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The name of the function
    \item Its parameters \& parameter descriptions
    \item Its return value
    \item A code example using the function. Please provide a recommended example \& discouraged example. 
\end{itemize}
