Connect to your **s2-24-intro-app-dev-playground** repository. When you push to this repository, **Render** will automatically deploy your **web service**. It is called **Continuous Deployment**.

Change the **Runtime** to **Node**, **Build Command** to `npm install`, and **Start Command** to `node app.js`.

Keep an eye on the logs. Your **web service** is ready when you see the following message.

Your service is live ðŸŽ‰
```

Scroll to the top of the page and click on your **web service's** URL.

## Kanban   

**Kanban** is a **method** for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on **continuous delivery** while not overburdening the development team. Like **Scrum**, **Kanban** is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively.

### Kanban Board

A **Kanban board** is a **work and workflow visualisation tool** that enables you to optimize the flow of your work. **Physical Kanban boards**, like the one pictured here - <https://bit.ly/3HrWSIl>, typically use sticky notes on a whiteboard to communicate status, progress, and issues. Instead, we are going to use **GitHub Projects** to create a **Kanban board**.

### Kanban Card

A **Kanban card** is a **task** on a **Kanban board**. **Kanban cards** are used to represent work items and convey important information about the work item through custom fields.
