# 10: React 1

If you get stuck, a completed version of this project is available in the **10-react-1** directory of the **lecture-notes** repository.

## Vite

**Vite** is a build tool that is used to create **React** applications. It is similar to **Create React App**, but it is faster and has a few other advantages.

## Create Vite App

1. In the **Terminal**, the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

2. Name the project **10-react-1**, select **React** as the framework and select **JavaScript + SWC** as the variant.

3. Change into the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd 10-react-1
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you try to run the development server before installing the dependencies, you will get an error.

5. Navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:5173/** in your browser.

You should see a page that says **Vite + React**
