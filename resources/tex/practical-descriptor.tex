\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time to discuss the requirements \& your assessment progress during the teaching sessions. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 05 May 2022 at 4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} across all assessments in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Submission}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/fZCB58Sl}{https://classroom.github.com/a/fZCB58Sl}. Create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest program files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test your \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch application before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without \textbf{ChatGPT}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use \textbf{ChatGPT} to help you get unstuck, permitting you acknowledge that you have used \textbf{ChatGPT}. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to \textbf{ChatGPT} \& how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} \& \textbf{GitHub}. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}. 

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Instructions}
You will need to submit a \textbf{suite of API tests} \& documentation that meet the following requirements:

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcome 1 (40\%)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Testing:}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{API tests} are written using \textbf{Mocha} \& \textbf{Chai}.
    \item At least \textbf{40 API tests} verifying the correctness of the following:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item CRUD (create, read, update \& delete) operations.
            \item Validation rules, i.e., checking if field is required, etc.
            \item Query parameters, i.e., filtering, sorting \& paging data.
            \item Status codes, i.e., checking if a response returns 200, 404, etc.
            \item Shape of the data, i.e., does the response data contain a specific field?
          \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{NPM scripts:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Linting \& fixing your code using \textbf{ESLint}.
		\item Formatting your code using \textbf{Prettier}.
		\item Running \textbf{API} tests using \textbf{Mocha}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Elegance - Learning Outcome 1 (45\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Environment variables' key is stored in the \textbf{env.example} file. 
  \item Database configured for the testing environment.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new database called \textbf{test.db}. \textbf{Note:} Do not use \textbf{dev.db}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Appropriate naming of variables \& functions.
	\item Idiomatic use of control flow, data structures \& in-built functions.
  \item Efficient algorithmic approach.
  \item Sufficient modularity, i.e., \textbf{before()} \& \textbf{after()} functions.
	\item Each test file \textbf{must} have a header comment located immediately before the \textbf{import} statements.
  \item In-line comments where required.
	\item Code is linted \& formatted using \textbf{ESLint} \& \textbf{Prettier}.
	\item \textbf{Mocha}, \textbf{Chai}, \textbf{ESLint} \& \textbf{Prettier} are installed as \textbf{development dependencies}.	
  \item No dead or unused code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation \& Git Usage - Learning Outcome 1 (15\%)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide the following in your repository \textbf{README.md} file:
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item How do you setup the testing environment, i.e., after the repository is cloned, what do you need to do \textbf{before} you run the \textbf{API tests}?
      \item How do you lint \& fix your code?
      \item How do you format your code?
      \item How do you run your \textbf{API tests}?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use of \textbf{Markdown}, i.e., headings, bold text, code blocks, etc.
    \item Correct spelling \& grammar.
    \item Your \textbf{Git commit messages} should:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reflect the context of each functional requirement change.
