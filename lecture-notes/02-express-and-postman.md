# 02: Express and Postman

## Express

**Express** is a web application framework for **Node.js**. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for **Node.js**. We will use **Express** to build a **REST API**.

## Postman

**Postman** is a collaboration platform for API development. **Postman**'s features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster. We will use **Postman** to test our **REST API**.
