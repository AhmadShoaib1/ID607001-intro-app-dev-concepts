# React 5 - Cypress

## What is end-to-end (e2e) testing?

In this lecture, you will explore **e2e** testing. You should be familiar with the concept of **unit** and **API** testing, where you tend to test your application's backend code. What if you want to test your application's frontend code? It is where **e2e** testing comes in. Before we look at **Cypress** and an example, you need to understand what **e2e** testing is.

**E2e** testing is a software testing practice that tests an application's (usually something visual) flow from start to end. It serves the purpose of simulating a real-world scenario, i.e., logging into an application, creating a new record, then logging out of an application. It ensures its components, i.e., login form for integration, i.e., what happens when a user logs in successfully and data integrity, i.e., valid user inputs.

## What is Cypress?

**Cypress** is a **JavaScript** testing framework that allows you to write a variety of different tests, i.e., **unit**, **integration**, **e2e**.
